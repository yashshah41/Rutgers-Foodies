Drawing from transatlantic and decolonial frameworks, the talk will examine how writers displaced by the Spanish Civil War and subsequent dictatorships negotiated cultural memory, spatial dislocation, and linguistic identity. Dr. Mu\u00f1oz-Mantas will highlight the aesthetic and political strategies through which exiled authors reframed notions of homeland, authorship, and subjectivity across fragmented geographies. The presentation will be of special interest to those working on exile studies, Latin American and Iberian literature, and political aesthetics.   Event 2Title: De doctorando a doctor en el mercado laboral en Estados Unidos: estrategias clave y recursosDate & Time: Wednesday, May 1st, 5:00 p.m.Location: Academic Building West, Room 5190Language: SpanishThis professional development workshop, led by Dr. Enrique Mu\u00f1oz-Mantas, offers an in-depth, practical session for graduate students preparing for the academic job market in the United States.
