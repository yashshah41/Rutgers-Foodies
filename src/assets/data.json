This event is open to everyone: general members, families, Rutgers students, and non-Rutgers students! Our showcase is our biggest event, where our members get to showcase a multitude of K-pop performances they\u2019ve been preparing for months for our audience. There are two acts with an intermission, which includes a raffle with a bunch of prizes our audience can partake in and possibly win big! And the best part is that admission is FREE for all!  You don't have to be performing to attend, so come out and support our performers! \u2661 Let's cheer each other on and enjoy each other's company! You may also get some sweet treats from us to enjoy while watching performances \ud83d\udc40 Our showcase is also livestreamed on our YouTube page for audience members who cannot attend in person, but would love to support our performers! If you're watching from online, thank you for supporting Haru Dance \u2661 More information on parking will be detailed here later in the semester. Contact us directly on IG: @harudance_official or Email: haru.kdcc@gmail.com if you have any questions! Can't wait to see y'all soon!",

Our speaker will be Parijat Banerjee, and we'll be ordering some delicious Indian food from Delhi Garden! Title: What do you mean you hate jazz? Abstract: \u200bWhy does the simple harmony of a pop song feel fundamentally different from the complex, \"messy\" interplay of a bebop line? In La La Land, Sebastian passionately describes jazz as \"conflict and compromise... it's new every time.\" While this sounds like poetry, research suggests it may be a quantifiable physical phenomenon. This talk explores a biophysical model of auditory perception that provides a neural basis for the distinction between consonance and dissonance. Join me in the journey to listen to some good music and understand the physics of neural harmony.",

This talk is from the RUMA Seminar series of talks; this semester, RUMA Seminar is a series of talks featuring undergraduates presenting on math-related research they have worked on. Abstract below.--Classical model theory studies the relationship between statements written in first-order logic and set-theoretic structures which interpret them. Beginning primarily with the work of Shelah, much of work in the field became dedicated to the herculean task of classifying all first-order theories according to their behavior, categorized in meaningful ways by certain \"dividing lines.\" We will introduce two characterizations of \"good behavior\" in first-order theories: stability and NIP, and present a two-cardinal theorem of Lachlan and Shelah that demonstrates what can be achieved within stable theories.",
