Dana Women Artists Series Galleries! Collins is a Brooklyn based artist that works across art and design. She is well-known for pushing the boundaries of art and design in innovative and experimental work in fabric, yarn, and other materials and techniques associated with textile media. Although she embraces a language of abstraction, bold colors, patterns, and symbols allude to queer and feminist references, sourcing further inspiration from interpersonal and environmental forces such as electricity, volatility, connectivity, and energy exchange.    Don't miss out\u2014RSVP today and join the Center for Women in the Arts at Douglass to view the exhibition during a reception and for a talk by artist Liz Collins on October 16, from 5:00 to 6:30 PM!

This talk is from the RUMA Seminar series of talks; this semester, RUMA Seminar is a series of talks featuring undergraduates presenting on math-related research they have worked on. Abstract below.--Under mirror symmetry, there is believed to be a correspondence between Fano manifolds and Laurent polynomials. When this happens, we say that a Laurent polynomial f is a mirror partner for a Fano manifold X. There is a change of variables known as a \u201cmutation\u201d which yields a family of mirror partners for X from the polynomial f. From this, we can construct a graph of all possible mutations and ask questions about the graph\u2019s structure. In this talk, we examine the mutation graph of f=x+y+z+1/xyz corresponding to complex projective three-space.",

Ambedkar envisioned education as the most powerful weapon against caste oppression\u2014a route to dignity, mobility, and collective emancipation. Yet higher education in India continues to function as a deeply casted institution: hierarchical, exclusionary, and violent in its gatekeeping. Punishing the Professor tells the story of Dr. P. Senrayaperumal, an Arunthathiyar scholar who rose from a hereditary performer\u2019s life\u2014a caste-degraded occupation\u2014to become a college professor. Through perseverance and deep study, he re-articulated Raja-Rani Attam as a form of dignified cultural expression. But his very success provoked the system\u2019s retaliation: he was dismissed from his post on the pretext of \u201cirregular academic credentials.\u201d The film reveals how the promise of education collides with the enduring structure of caste. It is a searing portrait of what it takes for a Dalit academic to survive within institutions that celebrate merit while policing belonging. And yet it is equally a story of resilience, dignity, and the quiet power of refusing erasure\u2014of turning art, memory, and intellect into resistance. Join us for a screening and collective conversation on caste, education, and the unfinished project of emancipation. All are welcome\u2014students, faculty, and community members committed to anti-caste thought and praxis.",
