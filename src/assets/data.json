Ambedkar envisioned education as the most powerful weapon against caste oppression\u2014a route to dignity, mobility, and collective emancipation. Yet higher education in India continues to function as a deeply casted institution: hierarchical, exclusionary, and violent in its gatekeeping. Punishing the Professor tells the story of Dr. P. Senrayaperumal, an Arunthathiyar scholar who rose from a hereditary performer\u2019s life\u2014a caste-degraded occupation\u2014to become a college professor. Through perseverance and deep study, he re-articulated Raja-Rani Attam as a form of dignified cultural expression. But his very success provoked the system\u2019s retaliation: he was dismissed from his post on the pretext of \u201cirregular academic credentials.\u201d The film reveals how the promise of education collides with the enduring structure of caste. It is a searing portrait of what it takes for a Dalit academic to survive within institutions that celebrate merit while policing belonging. And yet it is equally a story of resilience, dignity, and the quiet power of refusing erasure\u2014of turning art, memory, and intellect into resistance. Join us for a screening and collective conversation on caste, education, and the unfinished project of emancipation. All are welcome\u2014students, faculty, and community members committed to anti-caste thought and praxis.",

        "description": "Come see a talk given by Professor Tim Bates from the Rutgers math department! Abstract below.--A planar graph is a connected graph which can be drawn in the plane without any edges crossing (we call this a planar embedding of the graph. We know that any planar embedding will satisfy Euler's formula (v-e=2-f), so no matter how the graph is embedded, I can tell you exactly how many complementary regions of the graph there will be. So we are able to express topological information about the embedding from combinatorial information of the graph. Any graph can be embedded into 3-dimensional space (we call such an embedding a spatial graph), and while we have more freedom when embedding into 3-dimensional space, a lot of topological information about the embedding depends on the structure of the abstract graph. For example, I'll prove that the complete graph on 6 vertices is intrinsically linked (a result due to Conway and Gordon).",

Yet unseen by the public, these films may not only rewrite Ghanaian and African history--but world history itself.   The screening will be followed by a live filmmaker Q&A and discussion anchored by Ambassador Abena P.A. Busia (Professor Emerita, Rutgers). There will be popcorn!   Please RSVP \"Yes\" on Get Involved by Monday, November 10 if you plan to attend. Non-RU student/staff may RSVP by emailing sbscenters@sas.rutgers.edu.   Presented by the Center for African Studies and co-sponsored by: The Department of History, The Busia Foundation International, Rutgers Global, and Crossroads Theatre Company.",

There are two acts with an intermission, which includes a raffle with a bunch of prizes our audience can partake in and possibly win big! And the best part is that admission is FREE for all!  You don't have to be performing to attend, so come out and support our performers! \u2661 Let's cheer each other on and enjoy each other's company! You may also get some sweet treats from us to enjoy while watching performances \ud83d\udc40 Our showcase is also livestreamed on our YouTube page for audience members who cannot attend in person, but would love to support our performers!
