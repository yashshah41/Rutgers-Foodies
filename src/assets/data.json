Understand their industries, current roles, and recent news or achievements. Have a list of questions ready for each company based on your research and interests.  Dress Professionally  Wear business attire that is appropriate for a professional setting. This helps make a good first impression.  Bring Necessary Materials  Always carry several copies of your updated resume. Consider also bringing business cards if you have them, containing your contact information and professional title or major.  Practice Your Elevator Pitch  Prepare a short, concise introduction of yourself, including your name, major, year in school, professional interests, and what you hope to gain from the event. Tailor it to be brief but informative, roughly 30 seconds.  Respect Time Limits  Be mindful of the time you spend with each representative. These events are usually fast-paced, and many other students may also want to engage with the same representatives.  Listen Actively  Show genuine interest in the conversation. Listen more than you speak, and nod or respond appropriately to show engagement.  Take Turns and Share the Space  Be courteous to other students waiting for their turn. If the table is crowded, keep your questions precise and allow others to join in.  Follow the Flow of the Event  Pay attention to the event\u2019s structure (e.g., timed rotations, open networking sessions). Adhere to the guidelines set by the organizers to ensure a smooth flow.  Exchange Contact Information  If a conversation goes well, politely ask for a business card or contact details. Offer your own card or resume in exchange.  Follow Up  After the event, send personalized thank you emails to the representatives you spoke with. Mention specific details from your conversation to remind them of your interaction.  Stay Positive and Open-Minded  Approach each interaction with enthusiasm, regardless of whether the company is on your list of top interests. Networking is also about discovering new opportunities.  Utilize Event Staff and Resources  If you have questions or need assistance during the event, don\u2019t hesitate to ask the event staff. They can provide guidance and help facilitate connections.

        "description": "Hi everyone,  RU Nu Rho Psi's annual research conference, AXON, is coming up soon! All students who are conducting neuroscience-related research are invited to present their research projects to an audience for the chance to win cash prizes. This year, AXON will be held on April 27th from 1230pm - 5pm in room 105 of the Psychology Building on Busch Campus. Students at Rutgers have the option to present their research via presentation of a physical printed poster during a poster session, or via a 15 minute slideshow presentation (10 minute talk + 5 minutes for questions). Students would not only be able to present their research at a conference recognized by the National Honor Society of Neuroscience, they would also have the chance to get their presentations judged for the possibility of winning a cash prize (a $150 prize, a $125 prize, and a $100 prize will be awarded). Attending and presenting at AXON is completely free, and food will be provided and catered (food will be catered from Jersey Mikes and Szechwan Ichiban). Students interested in presenting at AXON 5.0 will need to submit their abstracts using the following form by April 19th at 11:59pm: https://forms.gle/6Ro3aqEK1kGeE5cq5   Since the theme of AXON this year is \"Exercise and the Brain\", Dr. Peter Douris, the keynote speaker, will be talking about whether exercise is the true ultimate modality for optimal cognitive performance (your neuroscience research does not have to be exercise related). Here is the website dedicated to the conference: https://axon2024.myportfolio.com/. Make sure to check it out. If you have any questions, feel free to contact nrp.rutgers@gmail.com.",
