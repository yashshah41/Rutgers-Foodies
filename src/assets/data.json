Join us on Wednesday, October 1, from 5:30\u20137:00 PM at the Kathleen Ludwig Center for Salsa Dance & Dinner Night. Kick off the evening with a lively salsa dance class, no experience needed, just bring your energy and comfy clothes! After dancing, enjoy a delicious dinner together as we honor the richness of Hispanic culture through music, movement, and community. In partnership with Douglass Women in Science & Engineering (WiSE), the event will also feature The Science of the Scent. Led by Magy Georges, Assistant Dean of WiSE, this interactive activity will explore how fragrance is created, how it connects to memory and identity, and how scents from Latin America such as vanilla, cacao, coffee, and citrus have shaped both culture and science. Participants will even get the chance to craft and take home their own unique scent!",

Publications such as Life, China Pictorial, Drum, Picture Post, and Ebony shaped public perception and mass media consensus like the Internet does today, bringing a shared visual experience to homes and newsstands around the world. The essays in this volume delve into the technologies and visual strategies behind these publications, showing how their layouts were affected by political, commercial, editorial, and artistic factors leading up to World War II. Featuring over 150 images, Print Matters traces how illustrated magazines evolved across countries and continents, offering new insights into their history and enduring impact on culture and society.   Andr\u00e9s Mario Zervig\u00f3n is a professor of the history of photography in the Department of Art History at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.",

Dana Women Artists Series Galleries! Collins is a Brooklyn based artist that works across art and design. She is well-known for pushing the boundaries of art and design in innovative and experimental work in fabric, yarn, and other materials and techniques associated with textile media. Although she embraces a language of abstraction, bold colors, patterns, and symbols allude to queer and feminist references, sourcing further inspiration from interpersonal and environmental forces such as electricity, volatility, connectivity, and energy exchange.    Don't miss out\u2014RSVP today and join the Center for Women in the Arts at Douglass to view the exhibition during a reception and for a talk by artist Liz Collins on October 16, from 5:00 to 6:30 PM!

You don't have to be performing to attend, so come out and support our performers! \u2661 Let's cheer each other on and enjoy each other's company! You may also get some sweet treats from us to enjoy while watching performances \ud83d\udc40 Our showcase is also livestreamed on our YouTube page for audience members who cannot attend in person, but would love to support our performers! If you're watching from online, thank you for supporting Haru Dance \u2661 More information on parking will be detailed here later in the semester.
