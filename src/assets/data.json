        "description": "What does it mean to survive\u2014intellectually, politically, ecologically, or aesthetically\u2014in a moment defined by crisis? When uncertainty and chaos prevail, those who endure must bend, not break. They must adapt, redirect, stay fluid. How do figures of water help us think survival not as a static state but as a process: precarious, contingent, always at risk of being swept under? Survival and water: two conceptual forces that converge in literary, philosophical, and political discourses across the German tradition. Whether in the form of biblical floods, rising oceans, or mythic rivers\u2014water stages a sight of duality: It is where life and death, healing and destruction, calmness and acceleration are able to meet in a resistant stream of becoming. To survive\u2014especially \u201cwith one\u2019s head above water\u201d\u2014is to inhabit the threshold between endurance and submersion, grasping for breath, clarity, meaning. At the same time, survival carries its own paradoxes: Who survives and at what cost? What kinds of knowledge or expression survive catastrophe, exile, war, or erasure\u2014and which are drowned out? Water leaks across genres and disciplines: as metaphor for time and memory, as site of passage and peril, as resource and threat, as a medium of cleansing, forgetting, or border-policing. Meanwhile, survival speaks equally to historical trauma and everyday precarity, to climate catastrophe and cultural memory, to the bodies that wash ashore and those that remain submerged in the archive. This conference seeks contributions that take up the dual themes of survival and water\u2014literally, figuratively, or formally\u2014as critical frameworks. We welcome engagements with water as metaphor, medium, matter, and menace, and with survival as a philosophical problem, a narrative form, or a historical condition. What does it mean to be in over one\u2019s head\u2014psychically, politically, or ecologically? How might \u201ckeeping one\u2019s head above water\u201d register both resistance and exhaustion? How are the concepts of water and survival marshaled by thinkers, writers, artists, or regimes? How do literature, film, and theory reckon with flood, immersion, drowning, or breath? What kinds of bodies are asked to stay afloat, and at what cost? Brief: how do we keep our head above water; how do we survive the current?",

        "description": "As a graduate student, teaching assistant, instructor, or friend, you may wonder about academic accommodations and accessibility. The Office of Disability Services is hosting a drop-in afternoon for graduate students interested in learning about the services that ODS provides. Come stop by the Graduate Student Lounge or join via Zoom and meet Coordinator Nychey Michel to discuss accommodations for: hearing, vision, and mobility conditions, learning disabilities, psychological diagnoses (such as anxiety or depression), chronic illnesses, traumatic brain injuries, ADHD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and more. Bring yourself or bring a friend to ask questions and learn about outreach efforts. Coffee and donuts will be provided while supplies last!   Questions or accommodation requests specific to this event? Please email dsoffice@echo.rutgers.edu, call 848-202-3111, or visit ODS in Lucy Stone Hall, Suite A145, Livingston Campus.",
