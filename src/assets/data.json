The event will in the following format: Graduate students serving in our speed-dating panel will be asked to give a short elevator pitch (3 minutes) on their research and experiences in graduate school to their undergraduate pairs for the first hour. Undergraduate students will also have the chance to talk to the research panelists about their experiences in grad school and any other questions they might have. The second half of the event will be dedicated to more in-depth conversations between undergraduates and graduate students with free food.   Any questions?

Join your fellow Douglass classmates, alumnae, friends, and family as each class is honored with a symbol representing the different class years. After you receive your charm, head to the ceremonial fires on the sacred path to make a wish!  Students should show their pride by wearing their class year colors (first years wear white, sophomores wear pink, juniors wear red, and seniors wear black). Every student will receive a charm, a token representing her class. All Douglass students, family, faculty, and alumnae are welcome! Refreshments will be provided at Ludwig immediately following the ceremony.  *Students in Knowledge & Power will receive 2 points towards their Douglass event requirements* ",
