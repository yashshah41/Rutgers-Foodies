The event will feature a variety of ice cream flavors and toppings, paired with board games, card games, and group activities that encourage participation and friendly competition.   This program will fulfill the goal of the Honors College by creating an inclusive and welcoming environment where students can connect outside of academics. It supports wellness by providing a low stress opportunity for students to unwind and it promotes community engagement by bringing together students from different backgrounds. By offering both food and activities, this event creates multiple points for involvement, making it appealing for the students that may come just for the ice cream but stay to meet new people and play games.   I believe that this event will attract a strong audience because it combines popular elements, free food and interactive entertainment, in a way that's approachable and fun. Its casual structure lowers the pressure to participate and makes it especially valuable for first year students who may be adjusting to the HC community and looking for an easy opportunity to make friends.",

Kick off the evening with a lively salsa dance class, no experience needed, just bring your energy and comfy clothes! After dancing, enjoy a delicious dinner together as we honor the richness of Hispanic culture through music, movement, and community. In partnership with Douglass Women in Science & Engineering (WiSE), the event will also feature The Science of the Scent. Led by Magy Georges, Assistant Dean of WiSE, this interactive activity will explore how fragrance is created, how it connects to memory and identity, and how scents from Latin America such as vanilla, cacao, coffee, and citrus have shaped both culture and science. Participants will even get the chance to craft and take home their own unique scent!",

        "description": "SSPAR is a seminar series where graduate students from the Physics and Astronomy Department present talks on any topic of their choice - research, hobbies, personal interests, or just something fun. The talks are usually accompanied with dinner, which the speaker gets to pick from local restaurants including Delhi Garden, Efes, Mamouns and more. The first SSPAR of the academic year will be held on October 2nd, and Lana Eid will be our first presenter. We'll be ordering some delicious Lebanese food from Evelyn's! Hope to see you all there! Talk Title: Lessons from Cluster Lens Models: The Giant Arc in Abell 370. Abstract: We aim to improve cluster lens modeling and source reconstruction by utilizing the full information in giant, caustic-crossing arcs lensed by galaxy clusters. Lens models are generally constrained using image positions and assuming point sources, but spatially extended giant arcs provide more constraints; however, they require a more complex model that accounts for the structure of the extended source. We use the Abell 370 cluster lens to examine how the constraints from lensed giant arcs compare with those from collections of point-like images. We find that existing Hubble Frontier Fields lens models cannot reproduce the Abell 370 arc in detail and result in unphysical source models. We then show that using the full arc as a constraint improves resolution-limited assumptions, local parameters, and critical curves in lens models. We also discuss a new python package currently being developed and designed for reconstructing lensed giant arcs, which we use to evaluate the speed and accuracy of different interpolation and regression modes for de-lensed data. We finally discuss how this new method can be utilized for both high-resolution studies as well as large surveys.",

Publications such as Life, China Pictorial, Drum, Picture Post, and Ebony shaped public perception and mass media consensus like the Internet does today, bringing a shared visual experience to homes and newsstands around the world. The essays in this volume delve into the technologies and visual strategies behind these publications, showing how their layouts were affected by political, commercial, editorial, and artistic factors leading up to World War II. Featuring over 150 images, Print Matters traces how illustrated magazines evolved across countries and continents, offering new insights into their history and enduring impact on culture and society.   Andr\u00e9s Mario Zervig\u00f3n is a professor of the history of photography in the Department of Art History at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.",

Dana Women Artists Series Galleries! Collins is a Brooklyn based artist that works across art and design. She is well-known for pushing the boundaries of art and design in innovative and experimental work in fabric, yarn, and other materials and techniques associated with textile media. Although she embraces a language of abstraction, bold colors, patterns, and symbols allude to queer and feminist references, sourcing further inspiration from interpersonal and environmental forces such as electricity, volatility, connectivity, and energy exchange.    Don't miss out\u2014RSVP today and join the Center for Women in the Arts at Douglass to view the exhibition during a reception and for a talk by artist Liz Collins on October 16, from 5:00 to 6:30 PM!
