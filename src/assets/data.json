Drawing from transatlantic and decolonial frameworks, the talk will examine how writers displaced by the Spanish Civil War and subsequent dictatorships negotiated cultural memory, spatial dislocation, and linguistic identity. Dr. Mu\u00f1oz-Mantas will highlight the aesthetic and political strategies through which exiled authors reframed notions of homeland, authorship, and subjectivity across fragmented geographies. The presentation will be of special interest to those working on exile studies, Latin American and Iberian literature, and political aesthetics.   Event 2Title: De doctorando a doctor en el mercado laboral en Estados Unidos: estrategias clave y recursosDate & Time: Wednesday, May 1st, 5:00 p.m.Location: Academic Building West, Room 5190Language: SpanishThis professional development workshop, led by Dr. Enrique Mu\u00f1oz-Mantas, offers an in-depth, practical session for graduate students preparing for the academic job market in the United States. With a focus on the particular challenges faced by international and bilingual candidates, the workshop will address key strategies for assembling competitive job materials, navigating hiring practices in U.S. academia, and translating graduate training into viable professional profiles. Attendees will also learn about essential resources and institutional expectations to support a successful transition from doctoral studies to academic careers. The workshop will include time for Q&A and personalized discussion, making it especially valuable for students in the final stages of their doctoral journey.",

Drawing from transatlantic and decolonial frameworks, the talk will examine how writers displaced by the Spanish Civil War and subsequent dictatorships negotiated cultural memory, spatial dislocation, and linguistic identity. Dr. Mu\u00f1oz-Mantas will highlight the aesthetic and political strategies through which exiled authors reframed notions of homeland, authorship, and subjectivity across fragmented geographies. The presentation will be of special interest to those working on exile studies, Latin American and Iberian literature, and political aesthetics.   Event 2Title: De doctorando a doctor en el mercado laboral en Estados Unidos: estrategias clave y recursosDate & Time: Wednesday, May 1st, 5:00 p.m.Location: Academic Building West, Room 5190Language: SpanishThis professional development workshop, led by Dr. Enrique Mu\u00f1oz-Mantas, offers an in-depth, practical session for graduate students preparing for the academic job market in the United States. With a focus on the particular challenges faced by international and bilingual candidates, the workshop will address key strategies for assembling competitive job materials, navigating hiring practices in U.S. academia, and translating graduate training into viable professional profiles. Attendees will also learn about essential resources and institutional expectations to support a successful transition from doctoral studies to academic careers. The workshop will include time for Q&A and personalized discussion, making it especially valuable for students in the final stages of their doctoral journey.",

This event will have free pizza and drinks, so be sure to stop by our last meeting of the semester! Read some reviews of the movies below: \u201cThere\u2019s a haiku-like purity to it: Look Back is as neat and yet also as overflowing as the four-panel strips in which its leads once diligently honed their craft. And if something so beautiful also feels too brief \u2013 well, that may be the idea.\u201d -Robbie Collin, The Telegraph \u201cSummer Ghost is an incredibly profound and emotionally moving film. It left a deep impression on me, especially since I\u2019ve felt almost numb to emotions lately. However, this movie was different\u2014it pushed me forward in ways I didn\u2019t expect. After watching it, I came to a powerful realization: my life matters... It also teaches us to follow our dreams and live with purpose. Even though I don\u2019t fully understand what love feels like, the emotions in this film touched me in a way that feels rare and special. It\u2019s not just a movie; it\u2019s a reminder of the beauty and potential in life.\u201d -Srv Frosti, Google Reviews",
