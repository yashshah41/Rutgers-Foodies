Our second speaker of the academic year will be Abay Zhakenov, who will be presenting on the 15th of October, at 5:30 pm in SRN 330. As always, dinner will be provided, and we'll update this space with the details shortly. Title of talk: No man is an island but the quantum impurity is Abstract: What happens when you drop a single foreign atom into a sea of electrons, or introduce one lone defect into a perfect crystal? At first glance, it seems too small to matter. Yet again and again, physics teaches us the opposite: a solitary \u201cimpurity\u201d can reshape the entire ocean around it. In metals, a single magnetic impurity can capture the attention of millions of electrons, weaving a hidden cloud of entanglement known as the Kondo effect. In other settings, impurities bind particles into unexpected quantum states, creating resonances and new energy scales that change the collective behavior of the whole system. In this talk, I will explore how these lonely outsiders - quantum impurities - become central players in many-body physics. Through a few vivid examples, we\u2019ll see how they reveal the richness of quantum matter, how they act as sensitive probes of their environment, and how they embody the paradox that sometimes, the smallest part tells us about the whole.",

Publications such as Life, China Pictorial, Drum, Picture Post, and Ebony shaped public perception and mass media consensus like the Internet does today, bringing a shared visual experience to homes and newsstands around the world. The essays in this volume delve into the technologies and visual strategies behind these publications, showing how their layouts were affected by political, commercial, editorial, and artistic factors leading up to World War II. Featuring over 150 images, Print Matters traces how illustrated magazines evolved across countries and continents, offering new insights into their history and enduring impact on culture and society.   Andr\u00e9s Mario Zervig\u00f3n is a professor of the history of photography in the Department of Art History at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.",

You can look forward to meeting new and old friends with a few guided conversation prompts. Location TBD.    \"Belonging to the postcolonial vernacular of Hinglish (potent cocktail of the Queen\u2019s and the people\u2019s English) timepass is a concept peculiar to the natives of South Asia. It encompasses a range of meanings, from killing time, to engaging in casual... activities that defy time\u2019s value. To do or invite timepass is to unmoor oneself from the weight of time, to surrender (for better or worse) to the process; all that matters is that time passes and we along with it.\" -From \"Timepass: A (Queer) View From South Asia by Anjali Arondekar Cosponsored by the Graduate Student Association    ",

She is well-known for pushing the boundaries of art and design in innovative and experimental work in fabric, yarn, and other materials and techniques associated with textile media. Although she embraces a language of abstraction, bold colors, patterns, and symbols allude to queer and feminist references, sourcing further inspiration from interpersonal and environmental forces such as electricity, volatility, connectivity, and energy exchange.    Don't miss out\u2014RSVP today and join the Center for Women in the Arts at Douglass to view the exhibition during a reception and for a talk by artist Liz Collins on October 16, from 5:00 to 6:30 PM!

Ambedkar envisioned education as the most powerful weapon against caste oppression\u2014a route to dignity, mobility, and collective emancipation. Yet higher education in India continues to function as a deeply casted institution: hierarchical, exclusionary, and violent in its gatekeeping. Punishing the Professor tells the story of Dr. P. Senrayaperumal, an Arunthathiyar scholar who rose from a hereditary performer\u2019s life\u2014a caste-degraded occupation\u2014to become a college professor. Through perseverance and deep study, he re-articulated Raja-Rani Attam as a form of dignified cultural expression. But his very success provoked the system\u2019s retaliation: he was dismissed from his post on the pretext of \u201cirregular academic credentials.\u201d The film reveals how the promise of education collides with the enduring structure of caste. It is a searing portrait of what it takes for a Dalit academic to survive within institutions that celebrate merit while policing belonging. And yet it is equally a story of resilience, dignity, and the quiet power of refusing erasure\u2014of turning art, memory, and intellect into resistance. Join us for a screening and collective conversation on caste, education, and the unfinished project of emancipation. All are welcome\u2014students, faculty, and community members committed to anti-caste thought and praxis.",

You don't have to be performing to attend, so come out and support our performers! \u2661 Let's cheer each other on and enjoy each other's company! You may also get some sweet treats from us to enjoy while watching performances \ud83d\udc40 Our showcase is also livestreamed on our YouTube page for audience members who cannot attend in person, but would love to support our performers!
