The goal of this is to provide pre-medical students with an additional resource as they navigate their pre-medical years and the medical school application process. In addition to being paired with a mentor, several mentor-mentee pairs will be \"bundled together\" based on some answers to this form. This will give students access to individualized help from their own mentor, as well as expertise on a wide variety of topics from multiple medical students. As of now, this program is prioritizing sophomores and above, but freshman can still apply!   Please fill out the form below by Friday, March 8th at 11:59 pm in its entirety so that we can best match you to a mentor and bundle that meet your needs and goals. All information will be kept confidential and will only be shared with the medical student coordinators and your individual mentor.     https://forms.gle/ysuzhVk5Ki6g94aeA   We look forward to reading your responses!   If you have any questions, please email Namarata Battula (nb638@rwjms.rutgers.edu), Hunter Skroczky (hs1154@rwjms.rutgers.edu), or Parth Modi (pm783@rwjms.rutgers.edu).",

After you receive your charm, head to the ceremonial fires on the sacred path to make a wish!  Students should show their pride by wearing their class year colors (first years wear white, sophomores wear pink, juniors wear red, and seniors wear black). Every student will receive a charm, a token representing her class. All Douglass students, family, faculty, and alumnae are welcome! Refreshments will be provided at Ludwig immediately following the ceremony.  *Students in Knowledge & Power will receive 2 points towards their Douglass event requirements* ",
