Yet unseen by the public, these films may not only rewrite Ghanaian and African history--but world history itself.   The screening will be followed by a live filmmaker Q&A and discussion anchored by Ambassador Abena P.A. Busia (Professor Emerita, Rutgers). There will be popcorn!   Please RSVP \"Yes\" on Get Involved by Monday, November 10 if you plan to attend. Non-RU student/staff may RSVP by emailing sbscenters@sas.rutgers.edu.
