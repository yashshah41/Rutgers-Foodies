The event will in the following format: Graduate students serving in our speed-dating panel will be asked to give a short elevator pitch (3 minutes) on their research and experiences in graduate school to their undergraduate pairs for the first hour. Undergraduate students will also have the chance to talk to the research panelists about their experiences in grad school and any other questions they might have. The second half of the event will be dedicated to more in-depth conversations between undergraduates and graduate students with free food.   Any questions?
