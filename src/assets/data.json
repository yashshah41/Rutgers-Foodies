When uncertainty and chaos prevail, those who endure must bend, not break. They must adapt, redirect, stay fluid. How do figures of water help us think survival not as a static state but as a process: precarious, contingent, always at risk of being swept under? Survival and water: two conceptual forces that converge in literary, philosophical, and political discourses across the German tradition. Whether in the form of biblical floods, rising oceans, or mythic rivers\u2014water stages a sight of duality: It is where life and death, healing and destruction, calmness and acceleration are able to meet in a resistant stream of becoming. To survive\u2014especially \u201cwith one\u2019s head above water\u201d\u2014is to inhabit the threshold between endurance and submersion, grasping for breath, clarity, meaning. At the same time, survival carries its own paradoxes: Who survives and at what cost? What kinds of knowledge or expression survive catastrophe, exile, war, or erasure\u2014and which are drowned out? Water leaks across genres and disciplines: as metaphor for time and memory, as site of passage and peril, as resource and threat, as a medium of cleansing, forgetting, or border-policing. Meanwhile, survival speaks equally to historical trauma and everyday precarity, to climate catastrophe and cultural memory, to the bodies that wash ashore and those that remain submerged in the archive. This conference seeks contributions that take up the dual themes of survival and water\u2014literally, figuratively, or formally\u2014as critical frameworks. We welcome engagements with water as metaphor, medium, matter, and menace, and with survival as a philosophical problem, a narrative form, or a historical condition. What does it mean to be in over one\u2019s head\u2014psychically, politically, or ecologically? How might \u201ckeeping one\u2019s head above water\u201d register both resistance and exhaustion? How are the concepts of water and survival marshaled by thinkers, writers, artists, or regimes? How do literature, film, and theory reckon with flood, immersion, drowning, or breath? What kinds of bodies are asked to stay afloat, and at what cost? Brief: how do we keep our head above water; how do we survive the current?",

        "description": "Come join us on Sunday, April 19, for Haru's biggest event of the semester, Spring 2026 Showcase! Our goal is to share Korean pop culture through the art of dance. This event is open to everyone: general members, families, Rutgers students, and non-Rutgers students! Our showcase is our biggest event, where our members get to showcase a multitude of K-pop performances they\u2019ve been preparing for months for our audience. There are two acts with an intermission, which includes a raffle with a bunch of prizes our audience can partake in and possibly win big! And the best part is that admission is FREE for all!  You don't have to be performing to attend, so come out and support our performers! \u2661 Let's cheer each other on and enjoy each other's company! You may also get some sweet treats, snacks, and refreshments from us to enjoy while watching performances \ud83d\udc40 Our showcase is also livestreamed on our YouTube page for audience members who cannot attend in person, but would love to support our performers! If you're watching from online, thank you for supporting Haru Dance \u2661 More information on parking will be detailed here later in the semester. Contact us directly on IG: @harudance_official or Email: haru.kdcc@gmail.com if you have any questions! Can't wait to see y'all soon!",
