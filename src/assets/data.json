        "description": "Join the Center for Women in the Arts at Douglass for a workshop led by acclaimed artist Liz Collins! This unique needlepoint workshop invites you to explore the meditative joy of stitching. Collins will guide participants through the myriad of stitches possible within needlepoint and share her distinctive methodology for creating improvisational designs, treating needlepoint as a slow drawing process in response to the grid.   Only open to Douglass and Art & Design students. Free supplies and snacks provided! Supplies are limited \u2013 First come, first served. All skill levels and forms of stitching are welcome and supported. This experience counts towards the Douglass Discovery curriculum requirement. R3: Career/Discovery/Professional Development/Research. Reminder: To receive DRC curriculum credit, you must complete a reflection survey. *Liz Collins is the 2025-2026 Estelle Lebowitz & Ann Beneduce-Lebowitz Artist-in-Residence.
