This talk is from the RUMA Seminar series of talks; this semester, RUMA Seminar is a series of talks featuring undergraduates presenting on math-related research they have worked on. Abstract below.--Impartial combinatorial games are two player, turn-based games where the allowed moves depend only on the position of the game, not the player. We will go over how to solve these games, how to add games, and how to classify games using the Sprague-Grundy theorem. Then we'll talk about vector games, which are a specific class of impartial games that are played on a grid. We will go over a few examples and recent results about vector games.",

Ambedkar envisioned education as the most powerful weapon against caste oppression\u2014a route to dignity, mobility, and collective emancipation. Yet higher education in India continues to function as a deeply casted institution: hierarchical, exclusionary, and violent in its gatekeeping. Punishing the Professor tells the story of Dr. P. Senrayaperumal, an Arunthathiyar scholar who rose from a hereditary performer\u2019s life\u2014a caste-degraded occupation\u2014to become a college professor. Through perseverance and deep study, he re-articulated Raja-Rani Attam as a form of dignified cultural expression. But his very success provoked the system\u2019s retaliation: he was dismissed from his post on the pretext of \u201cirregular academic credentials.\u201d The film reveals how the promise of education collides with the enduring structure of caste. It is a searing portrait of what it takes for a Dalit academic to survive within institutions that celebrate merit while policing belonging. And yet it is equally a story of resilience, dignity, and the quiet power of refusing erasure\u2014of turning art, memory, and intellect into resistance. Join us for a screening and collective conversation on caste, education, and the unfinished project of emancipation. All are welcome\u2014students, faculty, and community members committed to anti-caste thought and praxis.",

        "description": "Simple Rajrah is a doctoral candidate in politics at the Department of Politics and International Relations, University of Oxford. Her research interests lie in feminist political theory, South Asian Studies, critical race and caste studies, and decolonial political thought. Her doctoral thesis develops an intellectual history of the Dalit women\u2019s movement between 1942 and 1995. In this talk, Simple will discuss the revisionist feminist history of the internationalization of caste and disrupt the standard narrative that hails the Durban conference in 2001 as an initiation point for the post- colonial internationalization of caste. It offers a three-fold contribution. First, it foregrounds Dalit women\u2019s efforts to internationalize caste and form transnational solidarities between women of colour between 1982 and 1995 by drawing on previously unutilized sources related to Dalit women\u2019s participation in multiple international conferences from Geneva to Phillippines. While it was inevitable to discuss the theoretical alignment between race and caste, their intent was not to litigate either as analytic categories but to suggest the operational similarities between them. Second, in so doing, Dalit women employ an interplay between caste and race as a useful heuristic to build political solidarity and argue that central to the operation of both race and caste is the oppressive control of women\u2019s sexuality. This functional approach to connecting race and caste is feminist in its focus on sexuality, especially as it expands our conceptions of sexuality\u2019s links to materiality (its embeddedness with land and labour relations) and disrupts the standard ways in which the debate on comparing race and caste has unfolded. Third, in doing so, this talk also recovers the internationalist origins of the National Federation of Dalit Women or NFDW, an organization formed in 1995 \u2013 first, by foregrounding how Ruth Manorama, an anti-caste activist who founded the NFDW, was invested in establishing the links between race and caste and internationalizing caste; and second, by showing how the creation of NFDW resulted from a disciplining of India under a new economic order that increased Dalit women\u2019s precarity and an impetus to form a national-level organization for representation at the upcoming Beijing conference. The formation of the NFDW was tethered to internationalism, she argues, as it was seeking inspiration from global conversations, participating at the global scale and looking forward to transnational solidarity.",
