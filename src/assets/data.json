We aim to inform others about political issues happening in the Philippines, and engage with members of the local Filipino Community. But most importantly we strive to educate, organize, and mobilize the community, starting right here at Rutgers, to fight towards achieving genuine democracy and freedom. Join us after the Involvement Fair (date tbd), to not only be given a chance to learn more about Anakbayan but also an opportunity for us to become more engaged in the Rutgers community.

        "description": "Scarlet Game Jam is a biannual game jam hosted by the Creation of Games Society at Rutgers University. Similar to any other game jam, participants will be given one week(ish) to design and code a game to show off at the end of the jam. At the beginning of each Scarlet Game Jam, we will also be unveiling the (optional) theme to inspire or challenge our participants, which changes with every Scarlet Game Jam, so each year is a new experience! Programmers, musicians, and artists are welcome, but no experience is necessary! Check out our website for more information: (TBD). This time around, the game jam is 2 weeks long to give everyone extra time to work on their games! Feel free to take the whole 2 weeks, one week, or even a single day to work on your game. Join the COGS Discord here! Any announcements about the jam will be blasted here: https://cogs.club/discord Make sure to sign up on our website to ensure free food for the in-person closing ceremony on April 14th. Schedule: TBD",
