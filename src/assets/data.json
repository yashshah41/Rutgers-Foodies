Similar to any other game jam, participants will be given one week(ish) to design and code a game to show off at the end of the jam. At the beginning of each Scarlet Game Jam, we will also be unveiling the (optional) theme to inspire or challenge our participants, which changes with every Scarlet Game Jam, so each year is a new experience! Programmers, musicians, and artists are welcome, but no experience is necessary! Check out our website for more information: (TBD). This time around, the game jam is 2 weeks long to give everyone extra time to work on their games! Feel free to take the whole 2 weeks, one week, or even a single day to work on your game. Join the COGS Discord here! Any announcements about the jam will be blasted here: https://cogs.club/discord Make sure to sign up on our website to ensure free food for the in-person closing ceremony on April 14th.
