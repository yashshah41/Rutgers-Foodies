Join your fellow Douglass classmates, alumnae, friends, and family as each class is honored with a symbol representing the different class years. After you receive your charm, head to the ceremonial fires on the sacred path to make a wish!  Students should show their pride by wearing their class year colors (first years wear white, sophomores wear pink, juniors wear red, and seniors wear black). Every student will receive a charm, a token representing her class. All Douglass students, family, faculty, and alumnae are welcome! Refreshments will be provided at Ludwig immediately following the ceremony.  *Students in Knowledge & Power will receive 2 points towards their Douglass event requirements* ",
