Drawing from transatlantic and decolonial frameworks, the talk will examine how writers displaced by the Spanish Civil War and subsequent dictatorships negotiated cultural memory, spatial dislocation, and linguistic identity. Dr. Mu\u00f1oz-Mantas will highlight the aesthetic and political strategies through which exiled authors reframed notions of homeland, authorship, and subjectivity across fragmented geographies.
