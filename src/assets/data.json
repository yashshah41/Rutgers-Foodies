        "description": "Evan is a third year PhD candidate in the Daniels Lab. His work focuses on defining long term neurological consequences following asymptomatic flavivirus infection. Using an adapted mouse model, he will illustrate that despite the lack of clinical illness, Zika infected animals experience acute neurological infection. While infection is rapidly cleared, these animals sustain robust neuroinflammatory consequences long after infection is resolved, including recruitment of long-lived inflammatory leukocytes. Further, transcriptional, metabolomic, and behavioral perturbations observed months after infection are consistent with phenotypes observed in models of neurodegeneration. Evan will discuss possible mechanisms by which these animals acquire this phenotype and potentially how it could be prevented. These findings argue even asymptomatic viral infection can incur chronic neurological consequences.",
