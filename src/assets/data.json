Similar to any other game jam, participants will be given one week(ish) to design and code a game to show off at the end of the jam. At the beginning of each Scarlet Game Jam, we will also be unveiling the (optional) theme to inspire or challenge our participants, which changes with every Scarlet Game Jam, so each year is a new experience! Programmers, musicians, and artists are welcome, but no experience is necessary! Check out our website for more information: (TBD). This time around, the game jam is a weekend long, so it's easier for people to find the time to attend. Join the COGS Discord here! Any announcements about the jam will be blasted here: https://cogs.club/discord Make sure to sign up on our website to ensure free food for the in-person closing ceremony on November 10th. Schedule: - Nov 8th @ CoRE 301 5 - 9 pm -> Kickoff Ceremony - Nov 10th @ Livingston Hall in LSC 12 - 10 pm -> Finale and Closing CeremonySee https://cogs.club/sgj for more information!",

You\u2019ll learn about cancer rates in POC women and the challenges they face in getting proper care.
