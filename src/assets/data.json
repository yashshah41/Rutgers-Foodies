Programmers, musicians, and artists are welcome, but no experience is necessary! Check out our website for more information: (TBD). This time around, the game jam is a weekend long, so it's easier for people to find the time to attend. Join the COGS Discord here! Any announcements about the jam will be blasted here: https://cogs.club/discord Make sure to sign up on our website to ensure free food for the in-person closing ceremony on November 10th.
