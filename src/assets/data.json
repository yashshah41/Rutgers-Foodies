The event will feature workshops along with lectures by guests from Princeton University\u2019s sustainable transit team and the NJDEP\u2019s DriveGreen EV incentive program, carpool matchmaking, petition signing, bike and helmet giveaways, and bike upcycling demonstrations. Through these activities, SEA will engage the Rutgers Community in advocating for greener transportation solutions on campus, encouraging Rutgers to implement initiatives such as bike lanes, improved pedestrian infrastructure, and sustainable transit options. Join us for a speed-walking race during the event for a chance to win 2 round trip tickets to NYC. Pizza will be provided for attendees!",

Programmers, musicians, and artists are welcome, but no experience is necessary! Check out our website for more information: (TBD). This time around, the game jam is 2 weeks long to give everyone extra time to work on their games! Feel free to take the whole 2 weeks, one week, or even a single day to work on your game. Join the COGS Discord here! Any announcements about the jam will be blasted here: https://cogs.club/discord Make sure to sign up on our website to ensure free food for the in-person closing ceremony on April 14th.
