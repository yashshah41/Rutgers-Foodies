This talk is from the RUMA Seminar series of talks; this semester, RUMA Seminar is a series of talks featuring undergraduates presenting on math-related research they have worked on. Abstract below.--Classical model theory studies the relationship between statements written in first-order logic and set-theoretic structures which interpret them. Beginning primarily with the work of Shelah, much of work in the field became dedicated to the herculean task of classifying all first-order theories according to their behavior, categorized in meaningful ways by certain \"dividing lines.\" We will introduce two characterizations of \"good behavior\" in first-order theories: stability and NIP, and present a two-cardinal theorem of Lachlan and Shelah that demonstrates what can be achieved within stable theories.",

This is open to any majors, but we are able to specifically help with revising essays or studying for sociology exams, since all of our E-Board is far into the Sociology major. However, if anyone wants to come with a friend to get work done or study for separate topics, that's also okay! We'll have study materials available (pencils, notecards, etc.) We're also making mocktails- including shirley temples, to enjoy during the study night. Come and hang out!",
