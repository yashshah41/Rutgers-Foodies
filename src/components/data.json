We feel great pride that Rutger's UBI is able to help in this beautiful drive hosted by Robert Wood Johnson Barnabas Health.&nbsp;Today, the country confronts new challenges that disrupt the blood supply. As concerns compound, blood centers nationwide are facing a decline in donor turnout, and donor eligibility misinformation. Yet the need for blood remains constant. We need youth like you to donate and save a life!&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Donors will receive a $5 coffee gift card, a jersey mikes sub, a t-shirt, and a chance to win 1 out of 4 $25 WaWa Gift cards!</p>",
